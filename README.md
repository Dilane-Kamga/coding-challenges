# Coding Challenges

Welcome to the Coding Challenges repository! This repository contains solutions to various coding challenges proposed by John Crickett(https://codingchallenges.fyi/), aimed at helping software engineers level up their skills through deliberate practice.

## Overview

Each challenge in this repository is designed to be a small yet complete project that can be completed in your spare time over a week or two. The challenges are based on real-world tools and utilities, providing a practical way to enhance your programming skills.


## Getting Started

To get started with the challenges:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-challenges.git
